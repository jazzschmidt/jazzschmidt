```sh
$ whoami
```

I am a Clean Code enthusiast, semi DevOps, music nerd, wine lover, and
test-driven software developer, always trying to learn new things. While
being really bad at understanding complicated stuff, I am on the other hand
really good at simplifying complex things once I could get them into my head,
which is what I do mostly in my professional time.

```sh
$ cat ~/workspace/info
```

Most of my public repos are the result of experimenting, are somewhat
useless, or just not finished at all. Nonetheless, feel
free to have a look or even support me. A few things might be interesting.

This README was inspired most by the one
[M0nica](https://github.com/M0nica/M0nica) published.
